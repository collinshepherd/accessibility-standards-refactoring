# Horiseon Accessibility Standards

## Description

This webpage was restructured to follow common accessibility standards by using Semantic HTML elements. It also contains an updated style.css sheet to remove repetitive selectors. Alt text as well as other accessibility comments were added to improve impaired usage of the website. I have added comments to the index.html file as well as the style.css file to improve future readability for easier understanding of what each part of the file is actually doing.

## Usage

To use this webpage. you can click on one of the 3 buttons on the top right of the webpage to direct you to each corresponding section to read about it. Accessibility usages should work as intended and provide an excellent experience to everyone.
